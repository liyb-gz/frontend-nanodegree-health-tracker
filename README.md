# Health Tracker - Frontend Developer Nanodegree Project

## What is this?
This is an application that helps to track your food and nutrition intakes, and to manage your daily colories intakes.

## How to install it and run it (I only want the production version)

1. Download the ZIP file from this Github repository (come on, you can find the "Download ZIP" button!)
2. Unzip the compress file
3. Open the unzipped folder, and get into the "**frontend-nanodegree-health-tracker**" folder
4. Now get into the "**dist**" folder
5. Double click the `index.html` file, and you will see the HealthTracker running in your browser.

## How to install it and run it (I want the development version)
Please make sure you have **node.js**, **npm** and **bower** installed on your computer.   
If not, please check out their websites and install them first, before you proceed:  

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)  
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)  
 
### If you have Git on your computer...

Good for you! Git makes things easier.

1. open a console (command window, or terminal) in the folder you want the health tracker to be installed
2. enter this command: `git clone https://github.com/liyb-gz/frontend-nanodegree-health-tracker.git`
3. get into the "**frontend-nanodegree-health-tracker**" folder
4. enter this command: `npm install`
5. then this command: `bower install`

Then the health tracker is ready for you!

### So you don't have Git...

No worries, Github allows you to download the package without Git.   
(However, you still need **node.js**, **npm** and **bower**)

1. Download the ZIP file from this Github repository (come on, you can find the "Download ZIP" button!)
2. Unzip the compress file
3. Open the unzipped folder, and get into the "frontend-nanodegree-health-tracker" folder
4. enter this command: `npm install`
